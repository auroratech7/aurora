# Hi, I'm Dinesh 👋🏾‍👨‍💻


I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community, online & offline. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Ethical Hacking, Java, Python (Tensorflow, APIs + Markup) and Android Developement. My interest in the Android Developement and open -source led me to contribute in more than 5 projects (Based on Android Open Source Project).
